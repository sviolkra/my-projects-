        <center>JavaScript</center>
    </h1>
    <h3>Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming
        language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0
        in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers. The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
            <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
            <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>
            <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>
            <li>Open and cross-platform.</li>
        </ul>
        Advantages of JavaScript
        <ul>
            <li>Less server interaction: <br> You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.</li>
            <li>Immediate feedback to the visitors: <br> They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.</li>
            <li>Increased interactivity: <br> You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.</li>
            <li>Richer interfaces: <br> You can use JavaScript to include such items as dragand-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
            </li>
        </ul>
